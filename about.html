						I am currently living in southern Maine, with my husband, two cats and a dog. The family has gotten both larger and smaller over the years, with the coming and going of pets and extended family members, the addition of our children’s significant others (and all THEIR collected pets) as well as long-distance relocations following college. I’ve learned to be flexible!

						My work days are now spent as a senior-level manager for a regional non-profit affordable housing organization, but my interests are quite a bit more varied. I am fascinated by online education as a vehicle for enabling many and diverse people to attain equal access to knowledge. I am a proponent of using games and game theory to enhance education and organizational performance. I am a student of online communities and how they compare and contrast with traditional ones.

						I enjoy classical and a cappella music, but also anything with a good beat, silly SyFy channel movies, technology of all sorts, and massive worlds created in literature, film and games. I participate in a real-time strategy-based game league with team members from across the United States and Canada. And I travel, as frequently as possible, to visit family and friends and to enjoy the world as I see it.
					</p>

					<p>
						Welcome to my world, hope you enjoy your stay!
